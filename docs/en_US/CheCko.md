# CheCko

Basically, CheCko is built as the login system of ResPeer social application. It also could serve as Linera block chain wallet, too. In CheCko, we implement Linera native token transfer, ERC20 like fungible token transfer, and web3.js apis. Web application can interact with Linera blockchain through CheCko like what they do with Metamask.
